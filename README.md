Capstone Project for CS2100

Project Description:

This website is a gallery of models and model kits that I have either built or collected throughout my life. It's divided into three main sections: Gundam, Miscellaneous Model Kits, and Work-In-Progress Models. Each section is divided into subsections to organize them into separate galleries. Users can click on images within the gallery to get my thoughts about each model or model kit present.
