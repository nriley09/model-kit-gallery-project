                <h2>Welcome to my Model Kit Gallery!</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website that will serve as a gallery for all the model kits that I have made over the years and the kits I plan to make in the feature.
                    I have been making model kits for several years now and have always wanted a place to showcase them to people who would be interested. Click on the
                    navigation bar above to move to each section of the gallery!
