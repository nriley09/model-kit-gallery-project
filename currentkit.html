                            The kit cost me $77.00 and I was able to get free shipping on the order because they had a 
                            deal for free shipping on orders more than $50

                            It took me around 6 months to build because I was incredibly busy between work and school; however, 
                            I spent around 30 hours altogether building it

                    <h2>Thoughts: </h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the first Master Grade Gundam I have decided to build! The build for the Blaze Zaku Phantom has been surprisingly
                        easy so far, and not very complex. The Zaku line of mechs from the Gundam series is my all-time favorite, so I decided
                        it would be appropriate to build one as my first Master Grade model kit.

                        It turned out to be a very fun build! I only had issues with the shoulder pieces as they would become loose very easily if
                        i rotated the shields to far. The kit has great articulation, but struggles with limited posability because of the bulkiness of the
                        figure. 
                    </p>
